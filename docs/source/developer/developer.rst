Developer Documentation
=======================

   :depth: 1

Local Environment
-----------------
For purposes of development, create conda environment `usansred` with file `environment.yml`, and then
install the package in development mode with `pip`:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> cd cd /path/to/usansred/
   $> conda create env --solver libmamba --file ./environment.yml
   $> conda activate usansred
   (usansred)$> pip install -e ./

By installing the package in development mode, one doesn't need to re-install package `usanred` in conda
environment `usansred` after every change to the source code.

pre-commit Hooks
----------------

Activate the hooks by typing in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> cd cd /path/to/mr_reduction/
   $> conda activate mr_reduction
   (mr_reduction)$> pre-commit install

Development procedure
---------------------

1. A developer is assigned with a task during neutron status meeting and changes the task's status to **In Progress**.
2. The developer creates a branch off *next* and completes the task in this branch.
3. The developer creates a pull request (PR) off *next*.
4. Any new features or bugfixes must be covered by new and/or refactored automated tests.
5. The developer asks for another developer as a reviewer to review the PR.
   A PR can only be approved and merged by the reviewer.
6. The developer changes the taskâ€™s status to **Complete** and closes the associated issue.

Updating mantid dependency
--------------------------
The mantid version and the mantid conda channel (`mantid/label/main` or `mantid/label/nightly`) **must** be
synchronized across these files:

- environment.yml
- conda.recipe/meta.yml
- .github/workflows/package.yml

Using the Data Repository usansred-data
---------------------------------------
Below follows a simplified rendering of the more detailed instructions on
`how to use a data repository <https://ornl-neutrons.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDPD/pages/19103745/Using+git-lfs+for+test+data>`_
(login required).

To run the integration tests in your local environment, it is necessary first to download the data files.
Because of their size, the files are stored in the Git LFS repository
`usansred-data <https://code.ornl.gov/sns-hfir-scse/infrastructure/test-data/usansred-data>`_.

It is necessary to have package `git-lfs` installed in your machine.

.. code-block:: bash

   $> sudo apt install git-lfs

After this step, initialize or update the data repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> cd /path/to/usanred
   $> git submodule update --init

This will either clone `usansred-data` into `/path/to/usanred/tests/usansred-data` or
bring the `usansred-data`'s refspec in sync with the refspec listed within file `/path/to/usanred/.gitmodules`.

You can make sure all the large files are downloaded by issuing a pull command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> cd tests/usansred-data
   $> git checkout main
   $> git lfs pull

Replacing or adding a file in the data repository
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
When adding a new test that requires a new data file, or when replacing an existing data file because of
some update to an existing test.

As an example, consider the data files used in
`tests/usansred/test_reduce.py::test_main() <https://github.com/neutrons/usansred/blob/next/tests/usansred/test_reduce.py>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   tests/usansred-data/IPTS-30410/shared/reduced/UN_EmptyPCell_det_1.txt
   tests/usansred-data/IPTS-30410/shared/reduced/UN_EmptyPCell_det_1_lb.txt
   tests/usansred-data/IPTS-30410/shared/reduced/UN_EmptyPCell_det_1_unscaled.txt
   ...

If we wish to replace any of those files with new versions, we simple overwrite the file(s) in the data repository
with the new versions. For the particular case of `test_reduce.py::test_main()`, the new files would be
located inside the temporary directory `tmp_path` that is automatically created when the test runs.

.. code-block:: bash

   $> cp /path/to/new/UN_EmptyPCell_det_1.txt tests/usansred-data/IPTS-30410/shared/reduced/UN_EmptyPCell_det_1.txt
   $> cp /path/to/new/UN_EmptyPCell_det_1_lb.txt tests/usansred-data/IPTS-30410/shared/reduced/UN_EmptyPCell_det_1_lb.txt

Assuming we only wish to modify these two files, the next step is to commit these changes in our local repository
*usansred-data* and then push the changes to the remote repository.

.. code-block:: bash

   $> cd /path/to/usansred/tests/usansred-data
   $> git add IPTS-30410/shared/reduced/UN_EmptyPCell_det_1.txt
   $> git add IPTS-30410/shared/reduced/UN_EmptyPCell_det_1_lb.txt
   $> git commit -m "Updated data files for test_reduce.py::test_main()"
   $> git push origin

We're not done yet! The next step is to update the submodule reference in our local *usansred* repository
and then push the changes to the remote repository.

.. code-block:: bash

   $> cd /path/to/usansred
   $> git add tests/usansred-data
   $> git commit -m "Updated usansred-data submodule"
   $> git push origin

That's it.
The new data files are now available to all developers who pull the latest changes from the remote repository.

If we want to add a new data file instead of replacing one, the procedure is the same only we won't be
overwriting any existing files.


Coverage reports
----------------

GitHuh actions create reports for unit and integration tests, then combine into one report and upload it to
`Codecov <https://app.codecov.io/gh/neutrons/usansred>`_.


Building the documentation
--------------------------
A repository webhook is setup to automatically trigger the latest documentation build by GitHub actions.
To manually build the documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> conda activate usansred
   (usansred)$> cd /path/to/usansred/docs
   (usansred)$> make docs

After this, point your browser to
`file:///path/to/usansred/docs/build/html/index.html`


Creating a stable release
-------------------------
- Follow the `Software Maturity Model <https://ornl-neutrons.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDPD/pages/23363585/Software+Maturity+Model>`_ for continous versioning as well as creating release candidates and stable releases.
- Update the :ref:`Release Notes <release_notes>` with major fixes, updates and additions since last stable release.
